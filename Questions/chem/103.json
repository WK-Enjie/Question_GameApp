      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Zn²⁺ gives white ppt with NaOH soluble in excess. CO₃²⁻ gives effervescence with acid. Could be zinc carbonate."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "White ppt with NaOH insoluble: Ca²⁺ or Mg²⁺. No ppt with NH₃ suggests Ca²⁺. White ppt with AgNO₃ soluble in NH₃ suggests Cl⁻."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Green solution and green ppt turning brown suggests Fe²⁺ oxidation. White ppt with BaCl₂ insoluble in acid suggests SO₄²⁻. Could be FeSO₄."
