    {
      "question": "For y = -2x² + 8x - 6, is the turning point maximum or minimum?",
      "options": ["Maximum", "Minimum", "Neither", "Cannot determine"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Coefficient of x² is negative (-2), so parabola opens downward → maximum turning point."
    },
    {
      "question": "The curve y = x² - 4x + 3 intersects line y = 2. How many intersection points?",
      "options": ["0", "1", "2", "Cannot determine without discriminant"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "x² - 4x + 3 = 2 ⇒ x² - 4x + 1 = 0. Discriminant = 16-4=12>0 → 2 real roots → 2 intersections."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the coordinates of the turning point of y = x² + 6x + 8?",
      "options": ["(-3, -1)", "(3, -1)", "(-3, 1)", "(3, 1)"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Complete square: x²+6x+8 = (x+3)²-9+8 = (x+3)²-1. Turning point = (-3, -1)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement about y = 3x² - 2x + 5 is correct?",
      "options": ["Coefficient of x² positive → U-shaped", "Coefficient of x² negative → ∩-shaped", "Has maximum point", "Intersects x-axis twice"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Coefficient of x² is 3 (positive) → parabola opens upward (U-shaped)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The curve y = ax² + bx + c has a maximum point at (1, 4). What can you say about 'a'?",
      "options": ["a < 0", "a > 0", "a = 0", "Cannot determine"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Maximum point → parabola opens downward → coefficient a must be negative."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many times does y = x² + 2x + 5 intersect the x-axis?",
      "options": ["0", "1", "2", "Cannot determine"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Complete square: (x+1)²+4. Minimum value is 4, so curve never reaches x-axis → 0 intersections."
    },
    {
      "question": "For y = x² - 6x + 9, what is the nature of the intersection with x-axis?",
      "options": ["Touches at one point", "Intersects at two points", "No intersection", "Cannot determine"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "x² - 6x + 9 = (x-3)² = 0. Perfect square → curve touches x-axis at x=3 (repeated root)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The curve y = x² + kx + 16 touches the x-axis. What is k?",
      "options": ["k = ±8", "k = ±4", "k = ±16", "k = 0"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Touching x-axis → discriminant = 0: k² - 4(1)(16) = 0 ⇒ k² = 64 ⇒ k = ±8"
