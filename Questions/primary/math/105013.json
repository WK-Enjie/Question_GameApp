    {
      "question": "Tom has 45 marbles. Jerry has 15 marbles. If Tom gives some marbles to Jerry, they will have equal amounts. How many marbles does Tom give?",
      "options": ["20 marbles", "10 marbles", "30 marbles", "15 marbles"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The total number of marbles stays the same: 45 + 15 = 60 marbles. When equal, each has 60 ÷ 2 = 30 marbles. Tom started with 45, so he gives away 45 – 30 = 15 marbles."
    },
    {
      "question": "A father is 4 times as old as his son. The difference in their ages is 27 years. How old is the son?",
      "options": ["12 years", "15 years", "18 years", "9 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The father is 4 times the son's age, so the age difference equals 3 parts (4 parts – 1 part). These 3 parts equal 27 years. One part equals 27 ÷ 3 = 9 years, which is the son's age."
    },
    {
      "question": "Sarah is 8 years old. Her mother is 32 years old. In how many years will the mother be 3 times as old as Sarah?",
      "options": ["6 years", "8 years", "5 years", "4 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The age difference never changes: 32 – 8 = 24 years. When the mother is 3 times Sarah's age, the difference equals 2 parts (3 parts – 1 part). So 2 parts = 24 years → 1 part = 12 years (Sarah's age then). Sarah is now 8, so years needed: 12 – 8 = 4 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Emma has 5 times as many stickers as Olivia. If Emma gives 36 stickers to Olivia, they will have equal amounts. How many stickers does Emma have at first?",
      "options": ["75 stickers", "120 stickers", "60 stickers", "90 stickers"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "When they become equal after Emma gives 36 stickers, Emma must have given away half of the original difference between them. So the original difference was 36 × 2 = 72 stickers. Emma had 5 parts and Olivia had 1 part, so the difference equals 4 parts. Four parts = 72 stickers → 1 part = 18 stickers. Emma had 5 × 18 = 90 stickers at first."

    {
      "question": "Peter is 8 years older than Paul. In 4 years, Peter will be twice as old as Paul is now. How old is Paul now?",
      "options": ["6 years", "8 years", "4 years", "12 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "In 4 years, Peter will be 8 + 4 = 12 years older than Paul's current age. At that time, Peter will be twice Paul's current age. This means Paul's current age equals the extra 12 years. So Paul is 12 years old now."

    {
      "question": "John is 12 years old. His father is 3 times as old as him. How old will John be when his father is 50 years old?",
      "options": ["24 years", "28 years", "22 years", "26 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Father's current age: 12 × 3 = 36 years. The age difference never changes: 36 – 12 = 24 years. When the father is 50 years old, John will be 50 – 24 = 26 years old."
    },
    {
      "question": "David is 15 years old. His sister is 9 years old. How many years ago was David twice as old as his sister?",
      "options": ["4 years ago", "2 years ago", "1 year ago", "3 years ago"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The age difference never changes: 15 – 9 = 6 years. When David was twice his sister's age, the difference equaled 1 part (2 parts – 1 part). So 1 part = 6 years (sister's age then). Sister is now 9, so years ago: 9 – 6 = 3 years ago. Check: David was 12, sister was 6 → 12 = 2 × 6 ✓"

    {
      "question": "Anna has twice as much money as Ben. If Anna gives $15 to Ben, Anna will have $5 more than Ben. How much money does Anna have at first?",
      "options": ["$50", "$40", "$60", "$70"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "When Anna gives $15 to Ben, the gap between them closes by $30 ($15 lost by Anna and $15 gained by Ben). After the transfer, Anna has $5 more than Ben. So the original gap was $5 + $30 = $35. Since Anna originally had twice Ben's money, the gap equals Ben's original amount. Ben had $35, so Anna had $35 × 2 = $70."

      "question": "A bag has 4 times as many red marbles as blue marbles. If 12 red marbles are removed, there will be twice as many red as blue. How many blue marbles are there?",
      "options": ["8", "10", "12", "6"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Originally there were 4 times as many red marbles as blue. After removing 12 red marbles, there are twice as many red as blue. The 12 removed marbles equal the difference between 4 times and 2 times the blue marbles, which is 2 times the blue marbles. So 2 times blue = 12 → blue marbles = 12 ÷ 2 = 6."

    {
      "question": "Kevin has $84 and Leo has $36. Kevin gives some money to Leo so that Kevin has twice as much as Leo. How much did Kevin give?",
      "options": ["$8", "$6", "$12", "$4"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The total amount of money stays the same: $84 + $36 = $120. After the transfer, Kevin has 2 parts and Leo has 1 part, so the total equals 3 parts. Three parts = $120 → 1 part = $40 (Leo's final amount). Leo started with $36, so Kevin gave $40 – $36 = $4."
