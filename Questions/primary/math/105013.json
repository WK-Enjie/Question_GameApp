    {
      "question": "John is 12 years old. His father is 3 times as old as him. How old will John be when his father is 50 years old?",
      "options": ["22 years", "24 years", "26 years", "28 years"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Father is now 3 × 12 = 36 years old. The age difference is 36 − 12 = 24 years, and this never changes. When father is 50, John will be 50 − 24 = 26 years old."
    },
    {
      "question": "Sarah is 8 years old. Her mother is 32 years old. In how many years will the mother be 3 times as old as Sarah?",
      "options": ["4 years", "5 years", "6 years", "8 years"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The age difference is always 32 − 8 = 24 years. When mother is 3 times as old as Sarah, their ages are in the ratio 3 : 1. The difference is 3 units − 1 unit = 2 units. So 2 units = 24 years → 1 unit = 12 years. Sarah will be 12 years old, which is in 12 − 8 = 4 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tom has 45 marbles. Jerry has 15 marbles. If Tom gives some marbles to Jerry, they will have equal amounts. How many marbles does Tom give?",
      "options": ["10 marbles", "15 marbles", "20 marbles", "30 marbles"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Together they have 45 + 15 = 60 marbles. When shared equally, each gets 60 ÷ 2 = 30 marbles. Tom gives away 45 − 30 = 15 marbles."
    },
    {
      "question": "The ratio of Lisa's money to Mary's money is 5:3. If Lisa gives $20 to Mary, they will have equal amounts. How much money does Lisa have at first?",
      "options": ["$80", "$100", "$120", "$150"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Lisa has 5 units and Mary has 3 units. Total is 8 units. After giving $20, they have the same amount, so each must have 4 units. That means Lisa gave away 5 units − 4 units = 1 unit. Since 1 unit = $20, Lisa had 5 units = 5 × $20 = $100 at first."
    },
    {
      "question": "A father is 4 times as old as his son. The difference in their ages is 27 years. How old is the son?",
      "options": ["9 years", "12 years", "15 years", "18 years"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Father’s age is 4 units and son’s age is 1 unit. The difference is 4 units − 1 unit = 3 units. Since 3 units = 27 years, 1 unit = 9 years. So the son is 9 years old."
    },
    {
      "question": "Emma has 5 times as many stickers as Olivia. If Emma gives 36 stickers to Olivia, they will have equal amounts. How many stickers does Emma have at first?",
      "options": ["60 stickers", "75 stickers", "90 stickers", "120 stickers"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Emma has 5 units and Olivia has 1 unit. Together they have 6 units. When they have equal amounts, each has 3 units. So Emma gave away 5 units − 3 units = 2 units. Since 2 units = 36 stickers, 1 unit = 18 stickers. Emma had 5 units = 5 × 18 = 90 stickers at first."
    },
    {
      "question": "Peter is 8 years older than Paul. In 4 years, Peter will be twice as old as Paul is now. How old is Paul now?",
      "options": ["4 years", "6 years", "8 years", "12 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The age difference is always 8 years. In 4 years, Peter will be 8 + 4 = 12 years older than Paul is now. But we are told that at that time, Peter will be twice Paul’s current age. So, twice Paul’s current age is 12 years more than Paul’s current age. That means Paul’s current age is 12 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Two baskets have apples in ratio 5:3. If 10 apples are moved from first to second basket, they will have equal amounts. How many apples were in first basket initially?",
      "options": ["40", "50", "60", "75"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "First basket has 5 units, second has 3 units. Total is 8 units. After moving apples, both have 4 units. So 10 apples moved = 5 units − 4 units = 1 unit. Therefore, 1 unit = 10 apples. First basket had 5 units = 5 × 10 = 50 apples."
    },
    {
      "question": "Anna has twice as much money as Ben. If Anna gives $15 to Ben, Anna will have $5 more than Ben. How much money does Anna have at first?",
      "options": ["$40", "$50", "$60", "$70"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Anna has 2 units and Ben has 1 unit. Total is 3 units. After Anna gives $15 to Ben, the total stays the same, but Anna now has $5 more than Ben. That means the difference after giving is $5. Originally, the difference was 2 units − 1 unit = 1 unit. Giving $15 reduces the difference by $30 (since Anna loses $15 and Ben gains $15). So original difference = new difference + $30 = $5 + $30 = $35. Thus, 1 unit = $35. Anna had 2 units = 2 × $35 = $70."

    {
      "question": "A bag has 4 times as many red marbles as blue marbles. If 12 red marbles are removed, there will be twice as many red as blue. How many blue marbles are there?",
      "options": ["6", "8", "10", "12"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Blue marbles = 1 unit, red marbles = 4 units. After removing 12 red marbles, red marbles become twice the blue marbles, which is 2 units. So, 4 units − 12 = 2 units. This means 2 units = 12, so 1 unit = 6. There are 6 blue marbles."
