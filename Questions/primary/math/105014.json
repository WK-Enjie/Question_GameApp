      "question": "The total number of marbles that Aiden, Bella, and Caleb have is 98. Aiden has twice as many as Bella. Caleb has 10 more than Bella. How many marbles does Aiden have?",
      "options": ["44", "50", "55", "60"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Let Bella have 1 unit. Then Aiden has 2 units, and Caleb has 1 unit + 10. Total = 1u + 2u + (1u + 10) = 4u + 10 = 98. So 4u = 88 → 1u = 22. Aiden = 2u = 44 marbles.",

      "question": "Ten years ago, David was 3 times as old as his daughter. The age difference between them is unchanged. If David is 55 years old now, how old is his daughter?",
      "options": ["20 years", "25 years", "30 years", "35 years"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Ten years ago, David was 55 − 10 = 45 years old. He was 3 times his daughter’s age then, so daughter was 45 ÷ 3 = 15 years old ten years ago. Now she is 15 + 10 = 25 years old.",

      "options": ["72", "81", "90", "99"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Before: Grace = 3 units, Henry = 1 unit. Total = 4 units. After giving 18, Grace = 3u − 18, Henry = 1u + 18. Difference = (3u − 18) − (1u + 18) = 2u − 36. This equals 24. So 2u − 36 = 24 → 2u = 60 → 1u = 30. Grace = 3u = 90 books.",

      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Before: Ian = 5 units, Jack = 3 units. Total = 8 units. When they become equal, each has 4 units. So Ian gave away 1 unit = $40. Therefore, 1 unit = $40. Ian had 5 units = 5 × 40 = $200.",

      "options": ["23 years", "25 years", "27 years", "29 years"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "The age difference is always 12 years. Three years ago, Emma was still 12 years older than Liam. At that time, Emma was twice Liam’s age, so the difference (12 years) equals 1 part. Thus, Liam was 12 years old, Emma was 24 years old three years ago. Now Emma is 24 + 3 = 27 years old.",

      "correct": 1,

      "explanation": "Let blue = 1 unit. Then red = 2 units, green = 1 unit + 8. Total = 1u + 2u + (1u + 8) = 4u + 8 = 68. So 4u = 60 → 1u = 15. Red = 2u = 30 marbles.",

      "points": 30,
      "explanation": "Before: Apples = 7 units, Oranges = 4 units. After: Apples = 7u − 15, Oranges = 4u + 9. They are equal, so 7u − 15 = 4u + 9 → 3u = 24 → 1u = 8. Total fruits = 7u + 4u = 11u = 11 × 8 = 88.",

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The age difference is 30 years (unchanged). Total age = 48. So if we subtract the difference: 48 − 30 = 18. This is twice the son’s age. Son = 18 ÷ 2 = 9 years old.",

      "options": ["15 m", "20 m", "25 m", "30 m"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 30,
      "explanation": "Before: Longer = 5 units, Shorter = 3 units. After cutting 8 m from each: Longer = 5u − 8, Shorter = 3u − 8. New ratio is 3:1, so (5u − 8) = 3 × (3u − 8). But without algebra, think in units: The difference before = 2u, after = (5u−8)−(3u−8)=2u (unchanged). In the new ratio 3:1, difference = 2 parts = 2u → 1 part = 1u. So shorter after = 1u = 3u − 8 → 2u = 8 → 1u = 4. Longer rope = 5u = 20 m.",

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 20,
