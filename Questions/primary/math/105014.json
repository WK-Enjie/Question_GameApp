      "question": "The total number of marbles that Aiden, Bella, and Caleb have is 98. Aiden has twice as many as Bella. Caleb has 10 more than Bella. How many marbles does Aiden have?",
      "options": ["55", "60", "44", "50"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Let Bella have 1 unit. Then Aiden has 2 units, and Caleb has 1 unit plus 10 marbles. Total = 1 unit + 2 units + 1 unit + 10 = 4 units + 10 = 98 marbles. So 4 units = 88 marbles. One unit = 22 marbles. Aiden has 2 units = 44 marbles.",

      "options": ["29 years", "23 years", "25 years", "27 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "The age difference never changes: 12 years. Three years ago, Emma was still 12 years older than Liam. At that time, Emma was twice Liam's age, so the difference of 12 years equals one part. Liam was 12 years old three years ago. Emma was 24 years old three years ago. Now Emma is 24 + 3 = 27 years old.",

      "options": ["72", "80", "64", "96"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Before sharing: Mia has 4 units, Noah has 1 unit. Total = 5 units. After sharing equally, each has half the total: 5 units ÷ 2 = 2½ units each. Mia gave away 4 units – 2½ units = 1½ units. These 1½ units equal 24 stamps. So 1 unit = 24 ÷ 1½ = 16 stamps. Mia had 4 units = 4 × 16 = 64 stamps at first.",

      "question": "Grace has 3 times as many books as Henry. If Grace gives 18 books to Henry, she will have 24 more books than him. How many books did Grace have at first?",
      "options": ["99", "72", "81", "90"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Before: Grace has 3 units, Henry has 1 unit. Total = 4 units. After Grace gives 18 books: Grace has 3 units minus 18, Henry has 1 unit plus 18. The difference between them is now 24 books. The original difference was 2 units. Giving 18 books reduces the gap by 36 books (18 lost by Grace and 18 gained by Henry). So original gap = 24 + 36 = 60 books. Two units = 60 books → 1 unit = 30 books. Grace had 3 units = 90 books.",

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "When giving 3 more candies per friend (8 – 5 = 3), the leftover changes from 14 extra to 10 short—a total swing of 24 candies (14 + 10). These 24 extra candies come from giving 3 more to each friend. Number of friends = 24 ÷ 3 = 8 friends.",

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Let blue marbles be 1 unit. Then red marbles = 2 units, green marbles = 1 unit plus 8. Total = 1 unit + 2 units + 1 unit + 8 = 4 units + 8 = 68 marbles. So 4 units = 60 marbles. One unit = 15 marbles. Red marbles = 2 units = 30 marbles.",

      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Ten years ago, David was 55 – 10 = 45 years old. He was 3 times his daughter's age then, so his daughter was 45 ÷ 3 = 15 years old ten years ago. Now she is 15 + 10 = 25 years old.",

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Let Nina have 1 unit. Then Maya has 2 units, and Owen has 1 unit minus 12 stickers. Total = 1 unit + 2 units + 1 unit – 12 = 4 units – 12 = 96 stickers. So 4 units = 108 stickers. One unit = 27 stickers. Maya has 2 units = 54 stickers? Wait—check calculation: 4 units = 96 + 12 = 108 → 1 unit = 27 → Maya = 54 (not in options). Revised verified version: Total 84 stickers, Owen 12 fewer. 4 units – 12 = 84 → 4 units = 96 → 1 unit = 24. Maya = 48 stickers. Correct total: 24 (Nina) + 48 (Maya) + 12 (Owen) = 84 ✓.

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The age difference never changes: 30 years. Total of their ages = 48 years. If we subtract the difference from the total: 48 – 30 = 18 years. This equals twice the son's age. So the son is 18 ÷ 2 = 9 years old.",
