    {
      "question": "Bingo is 9 years old. Her mum Chilli is 33 years old. How many years ago was Chilli 3 times as old as Bingo?",
      "options": ["2 years ago", "4 years ago", "3 years ago", "5 years ago"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "The age difference never changes: 33 – 9 = 24 years. When Chilli was 3 times Bingo's age, the difference equals 2 parts (3 parts – 1 part). So 2 parts = 24 years → 1 part = 12 years (Bingo's age then). Bingo is now 9, so years ago: 12 – 9 = 3 years ago. Check: Chilli was 30, Bingo was 6 → 30 = 3 × 6 ✓"

      "question": "Bluey has 45 craft sticks. Bingo has 15 craft sticks. Bluey gives some sticks to Bingo so they have equal amounts. How many sticks does Bluey give?",
      "options": ["12 sticks", "20 sticks", "18 sticks", "15 sticks"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The total number of sticks stays the same: 45 + 15 = 60 sticks. When equal, each has 60 ÷ 2 = 30 sticks. Bluey started with 45, so she gives away 45 – 30 = 15 sticks."

      "question": "Bandit bought some sausages for a barbecue. If he gives 3 sausages to each guest, he has 16 left. If he gives 5 sausages to each guest, he has 4 left. How many guests are there?",
      "options": ["8 guests", "7 guests", "9 guests", "6 guests"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "When giving 2 more sausages per guest (5 – 3 = 2), the leftover decreases by 12 sausages (16 – 4 = 12). These 12 extra sausages were used to give 2 more to each guest. Number of guests: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 guests."

    {
      "question": "Rusty has 3 times as many toy cars as Bluey. If Rusty gives 18 toy cars to Bluey, they will have the same number. How many toy cars did Rusty have at first?",
      "options": ["48 cars", "36 cars", "60 cars", "54 cars"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "When they become equal, Rusty must have given away half of the difference between them. Since Rusty gave 18 cars to become equal, the original difference was 18 × 2 = 36 cars. Rusty had 3 times as many as Bluey, so Rusty had 3 parts and Bluey had 1 part. The difference of 2 parts equals 36 cars → 1 part = 18 cars. Rusty had 3 × 18 = 54 cars at first."

      "question": "Winton and his cousins want to buy a soccer ball. If each contributes $6, they are short of $12. If each contributes $9, they have $6 extra. How many children are sharing the cost?",
      "options": ["5 children", "8 children", "7 children", "6 children"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "When each child contributes $3 more ($9 – $6 = $3), the group changes from being $12 short to having $6 extra—a total swing of $18 ($12 + $6). This $18 comes from each child adding $3. Number of children: $18 ÷ $3 = 6 children."

      "question": "Ninty collected leaves. If she bundles 4 leaves in each group, 2 leaves remain. If she bundles 6 leaves in each group, 4 leaves remain. How many leaves did Ninty collect (fewer than 30)?",
      "options": ["18 leaves", "14 leaves", "22 leaves", "26 leaves"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 25,
      "explanation": "Numbers that leave 2 leftover when bundled 4 per group: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26... Which leaves 4 leftover when bundled 6 per group? 22 ÷ 6 = 3 groups with 4 left ✓. Total leaves = 22. Check: 22 ÷ 4 = 5 groups with 2 left ✓; 22 ÷ 6 = 3 groups with 4 left ✓"

      "question": "Jackie is 5 years older than Rusty. Four years ago, the sum of their ages was 23 years. How old is Rusty now?",
      "options": ["11 years", "14 years", "12 years", "13 years"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Four years ago, both were 4 years younger, so together they were 8 years younger than now (4 + 4 = 8). Their total age now: 23 + 8 = 31 years. Jackie is 5 years older than Rusty. If we remove Jackie's extra 5 years, they would have equal ages totaling 31 – 5 = 26 years. So Rusty's age now: 26 ÷ 2 = 13 years."

      "question": "Lockheed Monster has 5 times as many crystals as Ninty. If Lockheed Monster gives 30 crystals to Ninty, they will have equal amounts. How many crystals do they have altogether?",
      "options": ["75 crystals", "105 crystals", "60 crystals", "90 crystals"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "When they become equal, Lockheed Monster must have given away half of the difference between them. Since he gave 30 crystals to become equal, the original difference was 30 × 2 = 60 crystals. Lockheed Monster had 5 parts and Ninty had 1 part, so the difference is 4 parts. 4 parts = 60 crystals → 1 part = 15 crystals. Total crystals = 5 parts + 1 part = 6 parts = 6 × 15 = 90 crystals."
