      "question": "What is 4/5 ÷ 2/3?",
      "options": ["8/15", "6/8", "1 1/5", "1 2/5"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "To divide fractions, multiply by the reciprocal: 4/5 ÷ 2/3 = 4/5 × 3/2 = 12/10 = 6/5 = 1 1/5"

      "question": "John has a rope that is 7/8 m long. He cuts it into pieces that are each 1/4 m long. How many pieces does he get?",
      "options": ["3", "3 1/2", "4", "2 1/2"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "This is a division problem: 7/8 ÷ 1/4 = 7/8 × 4/1 = 28/8 = 7/2 = 3 1/2 pieces. He gets 3 whole pieces and a half-piece."

      "question": "A box contains 24 chocolates. 3/8 of them are dark chocolate and the rest are milk chocolate. How many chocolates are milk chocolate?",
      "options": ["9", "12", "15", "18"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "First, find dark chocolates: 3/8 of 24 = 9. Then, milk chocolates = Total - Dark = 24 - 9 = 15."

      "question": "Sarah read 2/3 of a book on Monday. On Tuesday, she read 1/4 of the remaining pages. What fraction of the whole book was left unread after Tuesday?",
      "options": ["1/12", "1/6", "1/4", "1/3"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Step 1: After Monday, fraction left = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Step 2: Tuesday she read 1/4 of 1/3 = 1/12. Step 3: Fraction left after Tuesday = 1/3 - 1/12 = 4/12 - 1/12 = 3/12 = 1/4."

      "question": "A tank is 5/6 full of water. After using 30 litres, it is now 1/2 full. What is the total capacity of the tank?",
      "options": ["60 L", "90 L", "120 L", "180 L"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The 30 litres represents the change in fraction: 5/6 - 1/2 = 5/6 - 3/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 of the tank. So, 1/3 of capacity = 30 L. Total capacity = 30 L ÷ (1/3) = 30 × 3 = 90 L."

      "options": ["6", "10", "12", "14"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Fraction of oranges = 1 - 2/7 = 5/7. Difference (oranges - apples) = 5/7 - 2/7 = 3/7 of total. So, 3/7 of total = 15. Total fruits = 15 ÷ (3/7) = 35. Number of apples = 2/7 of 35 = 10."

      "question": "Mr. Lee gave 1/5 of his money to his son and 2/3 of the remainder to his daughter. He had $200 left. How much money did he have at first?",
      "options": ["$600", "$750", "$900", "$1200"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Let total money be 1 unit. After giving to son, remainder = 4/5. He gave 2/3 of 4/5 = 8/15 to daughter. Total given = 1/5 + 8/15 = 3/15 + 8/15 = 11/15. Left = 4/15. So, 4/15 of total = $200. Total = $200 ÷ (4/15) = $200 × (15/4) = $750."

    {
      "question": "A bag contains red, blue, and green marbles. 2/9 of the marbles are red. 1/3 of the marbles are blue. The rest are green. There are 40 green marbles. How many marbles are there in total?",
      "options": ["72", "81", "90", "108"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Red = 2/9, Blue = 1/3 = 3/9. So Red + Blue = 5/9. Green = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9. 4/9 of total = 40. Total = 40 ÷ (4/9) = 40 × (9/4) = 90 marbles."

      "question": "A farmer has some chickens and cows. 3/7 of the animals are chickens. There are 16 more cows than chickens. How many animals does the farmer have in total?",
      "options": ["70", "84", "98", "112"],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Let total animals be T. Chickens = 3/7 T, Cows = 4/7 T. Difference (cows - chickens) = 1/7 T = 16. So T = 16 × 7 = 112 animals."

      "question": "A tank was 1/4 full. After adding 12 litres of water, it became 1/2 full. What is the capacity of the tank?",
      "options": ["36 L", "48 L", "60 L", "72 L"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The 12 litres represents the difference between 1/2 and 1/4: 1/2 - 1/4 = 2/4 - 1/4 = 1/4 of the tank. So, 1/4 of capacity = 12 L. Capacity = 12 × 4 = 48 L."
