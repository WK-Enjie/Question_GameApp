(not integer)\nWait, this doesn't work with units. Let's use actual numbers:\nLet total = T.\nApples = 3T/8, Oranges = 5T/8.\nAfter selling 40 oranges: Oranges = 5T/8 - 40, Total = T - 40.\nApples = 3T/8 = 3/7 × (T - 40)\nCross multiply: 7 × 3T/8 = 3 × (T - 40)\n21T/8 = 3T - 120\nMultiply by 8: 21T = 24T - 960\n3T = 960\nT = 320\nSo total fruits at first = 320"
