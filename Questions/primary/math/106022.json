      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "HCF of 48 and 72 is 24. 48 ÷ 24 = 2, 72 ÷ 24 = 3 → 2 : 3."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Total parts = 5 + 7 = 12. 12u = 108 → u = 9. Boys = 45, Girls = 63. Difference = 63 − 45 = 18."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Amy = 3u, Ben = 5u. Difference = 2u = $48 → u = 24. Amy = 3 × 24 = $72."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Difference = 5u − 2u = 3u. $21 is half the difference → 1.5u = 21 → u = 14. Ali = 5 × 14 = $70."
