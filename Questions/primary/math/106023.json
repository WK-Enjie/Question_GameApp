      "question": "The ratio of Alex's money to Ben's money was 3 : 2. After Alex gave Ben $15, they had the same amount. What was the TOTAL amount of money they had?",
      "options": ["$90", "$120", "$150", "$180"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Total amount stays unchanged during transfer. Initial ratio 3 : 2 → total 5 units. After transfer, ratio 1 : 1 → total 2 parts. Make totals equal: 3 : 2 = 6 : 4 (total 10 units), 1 : 1 = 5 : 5 (total 10 units). Alex gave 1 unit = $15. Total = 10 units = 10 × $15 = $150."

      "options": ["32", "40", "48", "64"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Blue beads stay unchanged. Initial ratio 5 : 3. Final ratio 1 : 1 = 3 : 3. Blue beads = 3 units (unchanged). Red beads decreased from 5 units to 3 units → decrease of 2 units = 12 beads. 1 unit = 6 beads. Total at first = 5 + 3 = 8 units = 8 × 6 = 48 beads."

      "options": ["24", "30", "36", "42"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Number of girls stays unchanged. Initial ratio Boys : Girls = 3 : 5. Final ratio = 4 : 5. Girls = 5 units (unchanged in both ratios). Boys increased from 3 units to 4 units → increase of 1 unit = 6 boys. 1 unit = 6 students. Girls = 5 units = 5 × 6 = 30."

      "options": ["8 years", "10 years", "12 years", "16 years"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The AGE DIFFERENCE stays unchanged. Current ratio 3 : 4 → difference 1 unit. Future ratio 4 : 5 → difference 1 part. Difference is equal (1 unit = 1 part). In 4 years, both ages increase by 4 years. Tom increases from 3u to 4u → increase of 1u = 4 years. So 1 unit = 4 years. Tom's current age = 3 units = 3 × 4 = 12 years."

      "explanation": "Flour : Sugar = 5 : 2. 5 units = 150 g → 1 unit = 30 g. Sugar = 2 units = 2 × 30 = 60 g. The ratio relationship remains unchanged regardless of quantity used."

John decreased from 7 units to 3 units → decrease of 4 units = 24 stamps. 1 unit = 6 stamps. John at first = 7 units = 7 × 6 = 42 stamps."

Breadth increased from 3 units to 4 units → increase of 1 unit = 6 cm. 1 unit = 6 cm. Original length = 5 × 6 = 30 cm. Original breadth = 3 × 6 = 18 cm. Perimeter = 2 × (30 + 18) = 2 × 48 = 96 cm."

Fiction decreased from 7 units to 3 units → decrease of 4 units = 60 books. 1 unit = 15 books. Total at first = 7 + 4 = 11 units = 11 × 15 = 165 books."

      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Initial ratio Adults : Children = 5 : 3. Final ratio = 1 : 1. The DIFFERENCE changed from 2 units to 0. Adults leaving (15) and children arriving (9) together reduced the difference by 15 + 9 = 24. This equals the initial difference of 2 units. So 2 units = 24 → 1 unit = 12 people. Total at first = 5 + 3 = 8 units = 8 × 12 = 96 people. (Verification: 60 adults, 36 children initially. After: 45 adults, 45 children.)"
