    {
      "question": "A student set up four experiments with potted plants as shown below: \n\n A: Plant with all leaves, placed in sunlight, watered daily. \n\n B: Plant with all leaves, placed in dark box, watered daily. \n\n C: Plant with all leaves painted black, placed in sunlight, watered daily.\n\n D: Plant with all leaves, placed in sunlight, not watered. \n\nAfter 2 weeks, only Plant A remained healthy. Which variable was being tested when comparing Plants A and B?",
      "options": [
        "Presence of water",
        "Presence of light",
        "Presence of leaves",
        "Presence of carbon dioxide"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Plants A and B both have leaves, water, and access to air (carbon dioxide). The only difference is that Plant A has light while Plant B is in darkness. This tests whether light is necessary for photosynthesis and plant health."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an experiment to test if carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis, students placed two similar plants under bell jars:\nPlant X: Under a bell jar with soda lime (absorbs carbon dioxide)\nPlant Y: Under a bell jar without soda lime\nBoth plants received equal light and water. What is the purpose of Plant Y in this experiment?",
      "options": [
        "To test what happens without any light",
        "To serve as the control showing normal photosynthesis with CO₂ present",
        "To test the effect of soda lime on plant growth",
        "To show that bell jars block carbon dioxide"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Plant Y (without soda lime) serves as the control group. It has normal carbon dioxide levels, allowing comparison with Plant X (experimental group). Any difference in results can then be attributed to the absence of CO₂ in Plant X."

    {
      "question": "A student designed an experiment using aquatic plants (Elodea) in test tubes. She observed that bubbles were produced when the plants were placed in bright light, but few bubbles were produced in dim light. What do these bubbles most likely contain and what does this experiment demonstrate?",
      "options": [
        "Carbon dioxide - showing plants release CO₂ in light",
        "Oxygen - showing the rate of photosynthesis increases with light intensity",
        "Water vapor - showing plants transpire more in bright light",
        "Nitrogen - showing plants absorb nitrogen from water"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "During photosynthesis, aquatic plants release oxygen bubbles. More bubbles in bright light indicates faster photosynthesis rate. Fewer bubbles in dim light shows reduced photosynthesis. This demonstrates that light intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis."

    {
      "question": "In a photosynthesis experiment, students tested the hypothesis: 'Plants need chlorophyll to photosynthesize.' They used a variegated leaf (part green, part white) and tested for starch after exposing the leaf to sunlight for several hours. Which result would support their hypothesis?",
      "options": [
        "Starch present only in green parts",
        "Starch present only in white parts",
        "Starch present in both green and white parts",
        "No starch anywhere on the leaf"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Chlorophyll (green pigment) is needed to capture light energy for photosynthesis. If starch (product of photosynthesis) is found only in the green parts where chlorophyll is present, this supports the hypothesis that chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Students set up an experiment with two sealed containers:\nContainer 1: Plant + mouse, both alive\nContainer 2: Mouse alone.\nBoth containers had enough food and water initially, and were placed in sunlight.\nAfter 3 days, the mouse in Container 2 died while both organisms in Container 1 were still alive. What is the MOST LIKELY explanation?",
      "options": [
        "The plant provided food for the mouse",
        "The plant produced oxygen that the mouse needed to breathe",
        "The mouse helped the plant grow better",
        "Container 1 was larger than Container 2"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "In Container 2, the mouse used up oxygen for respiration and produced carbon dioxide. Without a plant to use the CO₂ and produce O₂ through photosynthesis, the mouse suffocated. In Container 1, the plant used the mouse's CO₂ for photosynthesis and produced O₂ for the mouse, creating a balanced system."

    {
      "question": "A scientist wants to modify an experiment to test if different colors of light affect photosynthesis rate equally. Which modification would be MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Use plants of different species under white light",
        "Use the same plant but cover it with different colored filters",
        "Use plants of different sizes under the same colored light",
        "Change the temperature instead of light color"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "To test the effect of light color while keeping other variables constant, use the same plant (or identical plants) and expose them to different colored light using filters. This ensures only the light color varies while plant type, size, temperature, and other conditions remain the same."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an investigation, students measured oxygen production by aquatic plants under different conditions. Their data showed:\n- High oxygen production: Bright light + added CO₂\n- Medium oxygen production: Bright light only\n- Low oxygen production: Dim light only\n- Very low oxygen production: Dim light + no CO₂\n\nWhich conclusion is BEST supported by this data?",
      "options": [
        "Light is more important than CO₂ for photosynthesis",
        "CO₂ is more important than light for photosynthesis",
        "Both light and CO₂ affect photosynthesis rate",
        "Plants don't need CO₂ for photosynthesis"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The data shows that oxygen production (indicating photosynthesis rate) is highest when both bright light AND added CO₂ are present. When either factor is reduced, photosynthesis decreases. This supports that both light intensity and carbon dioxide availability affect photosynthesis rate."

      "question": "A farmer noticed his greenhouse plants grew better when he placed containers of baking soda solution around them. What is the MOST LIKELY scientific explanation?",
      "options": [
        "Baking soda solution released oxygen for the plants",
        "Baking soda solution provided extra carbon dioxide for photosynthesis",
        "Baking soda killed pests that were harming the plants",
        "Baking soda reflected more light onto the plants"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can release carbon dioxide in the presence of acids (from soil or plant respiration). More carbon dioxide in the greenhouse atmosphere increases the rate of photosynthesis, leading to better plant growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Students conducted an experiment where they measured the mass of a plant before and after 4 weeks of growth. They found the plant gained mass. Some students concluded this proves photosynthesis produces food. Why might this conclusion be incomplete?",
      "options": [
        "They didn't measure oxygen production",
        "Mass gain could come from water and minerals absorbed by roots, not just photosynthesis",
        "They should have measured the plant's height instead",
        "Four weeks is too short a time to see mass changes"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "While photosynthesis produces sugar (food), plants also gain mass from water absorbed by roots and minerals from soil. A better experiment would test specifically for starch (photosynthesis product) in leaves or measure gas exchange (oxygen production, carbon dioxide consumption) to directly demonstrate photosynthesis."

    {
      "question": "In a photosynthesis experiment, a student tested leaves from plants grown in different conditions for starch using iodine solution. The results were:\nPlant A (sunlight + water): Dark blue-black color. \nPlant B (darkness + water): Yellow-brown color. \nPlant C (sunlight + no water): Yellow-brown color. \n\nWhat is the BEST way to improve this experimental design according to the 'fair test' principle?",
      "options": [
        "Test more plants to get better averages",
        "Change two variables at once to save time",
        "Test ONE variable at a time: compare A vs B for light effect (water constant), then A vs C for water effect (light constant)",
        "Use different types of plants for each condition"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "A proper fair test changes only ONE variable at a time. To test light effect: compare Plant A (light+water) vs Plant B (dark+water) – water kept constant. To test water effect: compare Plant A (light+water) vs Plant C (light+no water) – light kept constant. Testing both variables simultaneously makes it hard to determine which variable caused the effect."
    },
    {
      "question": "If you wanted to modify the classic 'leaf in light vs dark' experiment to make it more accurate, which improvement would be MOST valuable?",
      "options": [
        "Use larger leaves from older plants",
        "Test multiple leaves from the same plant instead of just one",
        "Use artificial light instead of sunlight",
        "Measure the exact amount of starch produced"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Testing multiple leaves helps account for natural variation between leaves. A single leaf might not be representative of the whole plant. Testing several leaves and looking for consistent patterns makes the results more reliable and valid."
    },
    {
      "question": "A scientist discovers a plant that can photosynthesize in very dim light, much better than normal plants. Which adaptation would MOST LIKELY explain this ability?",
      "options": [
        "Larger leaves to catch more light",
        "More chlorophyll or special pigments that absorb dim light efficiently",
        "Thicker leaves to store more water",
        "Deeper roots to absorb more nutrients"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "To photosynthesize effectively in dim light, a plant would need more efficient light-absorbing pigments. More chlorophyll or specialized pigments that can capture the limited available light would allow better photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "If you test a plant leaf for starch at night and find no starch, does this prove photosynthesis doesn't occur at night?",
      "options": [
        "No, because plants use up stored starch at night for respiration",
        "Yes, starch presence directly shows photosynthesis occurred",
        "No, because starch tests only work during daytime",
        "Yes, photosynthesis always produces starch immediately"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Finding no starch at night doesn't prove photosynthesis doesn't occur. Plants respire at night, using stored starch for energy. The absence of starch could simply mean it was used up during the night. To test photosynthesis at night, measure oxygen production directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Students repeated a photosynthesis experiment three times and got these results for oxygen bubbles counted in 5 minutes: Trial 1: 25 bubbles, Trial 2: 28 bubbles, Trial 3: 2 bubbles. What should they do FIRST to ensure reliable conclusions?",
      "options": [
        "Calculate the average of all three trials (25+28+2 = 55 ÷ 3 ≈ 18 bubbles)",
        "Check Trial 3 for possible errors since it's very different from the others",
        "Use only Trial 2's result because it's likely the most accurate",
        "Report all three results separately without any analysis"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "When results vary widely, you should first check for experimental errors or anomalies. Trial 3's result (2 bubbles) is very different from Trials 1 and 2 (25, 28), suggesting a possible error (e.g., blocked tube, timing mistake). Investigating this ensures data quality before drawing conclusions."

    {
      "question": "Considering the Sun is our primary energy source, what would be the ULTIMATE effect on an ecosystem if photosynthesis suddenly stopped in all plants?",
      "options": [
        "Animals would find other food sources",
        "Only herbivores would be affected",
        "The entire food chain would collapse as energy flow stops",
        "Decomposers would take over as primary energy users"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy (food). If photosynthesis stopped, plants wouldn't produce food. Herbivores would starve, then carnivores that eat herbivores would starve, and so on. The entire food chain depends on plants capturing the Sun's energy through photosynthesis."
