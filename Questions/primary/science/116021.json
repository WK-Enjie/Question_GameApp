      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A force is defined as a push or a pull. It can cause objects to move, stop, change speed, change direction, or change shape."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The football was stationary before the kick. The force of the kick moves it, demonstrating that a force can move a stationary object."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "When you stretch a rubber band, you are applying a force that stretches it. The rubber band exerts an elastic spring force trying to return to its original shape."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "When compressed, a spring stores elastic potential energy. When released, the elastic spring force acts to return the spring to its original shape."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Weight depends on gravitational force. The Moon's gravity is about 1/6 of Earth's, so your weight would be about 1/6 of what it is on Earth."

      "question": "Why is it harder to pedal a bicycle on a sandy path compared to a paved road?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Sand creates more friction than a smooth paved surface. The wheels sink into sand, increasing frictional force and making it harder to pedal."

      "question": "Which object experiences gravitational force?",
      "options": [
        "Only heavy objects",
        "Only objects that are falling",

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "All objects on Earth experience gravitational force pulling them toward the Earth's center. This gives all objects weight, regardless of their size or material."

    {
      "question": "A spring is stretched and then released. What energy conversion occurs?",
      "options": [
        "Kinetic energy → Gravitational potential energy",

      ],
      "correct": 3,

        "Friction is only useful in sports, not in daily life",
        "Friction is only important for heavy objects",
        "Friction can be useful - it helps us walk without slipping and cars stop safely"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Friction has both advantages and disadvantages. Useful friction helps us walk, write with pencils, and vehicles brake safely. Unwanted friction causes wear and wastes energy in machines."
