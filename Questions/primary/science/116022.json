    {
      "question": "A child pulls a toy car along a rough carpet. Which force opposes the motion of the car?",
      "options": [
        "Gravitational force",
        "Elastic spring force",
        "Magnetic force",
        "Frictional force"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Frictional force acts between the car’s wheels and the carpet, opposing its motion and making it harder to pull."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can astronauts jump higher on the Moon than on Earth?",
      "options": [
        "Because they wear lighter suits",
        "Because the Moon has no gravity",
        "Because gravitational force is weaker on the Moon",
        "Because there is more friction on the Moon"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "The Moon’s gravitational force is about 1/6th of Earth’s, so astronauts weigh less and can jump higher with the same effort."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following uses elastic spring force?",
      "options": [
        "A falling raindrop",
        "A bouncing basketball",
        "A sliding book",
        "A parked bicycle"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "When a basketball hits the ground, it deforms slightly and then springs back due to elastic spring force, causing it to bounce."
    },
    {
      "question": "Applying wax to skis helps a skier go faster. Why?",
      "options": [
        "It increases gravitational force",
        "It reduces friction between the ski and snow",
        "It adds elastic spring force",
        "It makes the skier heavier"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Wax creates a smoother surface, reducing friction between the ski and snow, allowing faster movement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement is TRUE about weight?",
      "options": [
        "Weight is the same on Earth and the Moon",
        "Weight depends only on the object’s volume",
        "Weight is caused by gravitational force",
        "Weight does not change with location"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object’s mass. It changes depending on the strength of gravity (e.g., less on the Moon)."

    {
      "question": "What happens when you add oil to the hinges of a squeaky door?",
      "options": [
        "Friction increases, making it harder to open",
        "Gravitational force decreases",
        "Friction decreases, making it easier to open",
        "Elastic spring force appears"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Oil acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between moving parts, so the door opens more smoothly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which object demonstrates that a force can change the shape of an object?",
      "options": [
        "A ball rolling down a hill",
        "A stretched rubber band",
        "A book resting on a table",
        "A leaf falling from a tree"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Stretching a rubber band changes its shape due to the applied force. When released, elastic spring force returns it to original shape."
    },
    {
      "question": "Two identical boxes are pushed—one on ice, one on concrete. Which requires more force to start moving?",
      "options": [
        "The box on ice",
        "The box on concrete",
        "Both require the same force",
        "Neither can be moved"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Concrete has more friction than ice, so more force is needed to overcome friction and start the box moving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following shows that forces act in pairs?",
      "options": [
        "A magnet attracting a paperclip",
        "Pushing a wall and feeling it push back",
        "An apple falling from a tree",
        "A spring returning to its shape"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "When you push a wall, you feel it pushing back on you—this illustrates Newton’s third law: forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Friction is useful when:",
      "options": [
        "Sliding down a metal slide quickly",
        "Writing with a pencil on paper",
        "Rolling a ball on ice",
        "Using a lubricated machine part"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "Friction between the pencil tip and paper allows graphite to leave marks—without friction, writing would be impossible."
