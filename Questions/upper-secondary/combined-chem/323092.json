      "question": "A water wave travels 90 m in 15 seconds. If 15 complete waves pass a point in this time, what is the wavelength?",

        "3 m",
        "12 m",
        "9 m",
        "6 m"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Wave speed v = 90 / 15 = 6 m/s. Frequency f = 15 / 15 = 1 Hz. λ = v / f = 6 / 1 = 6 m."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which frequency is within the typical human audible range?",

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The human audible range is approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. 15,000 Hz is within this range."

        "Frequency"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Pitch is determined by frequency: higher frequency → higher pitch. Loudness is determined by amplitude."

    {
      "question": "In which medium does sound travel fastest?",
      "options": [
        "Water",

        "They have the same frequency but different amplitudes",
        "They are produced by different sources only"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Same pitch → same frequency. Different loudness → different amplitudes. Speed and wavelength may be the same if in the same medium."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Sound is a mechanical wave and requires particles to vibrate. Space is mostly vacuum — no medium → no sound propagation."

      "question": "A wave has a period of 0.004 s. Is it audible to humans?",
      "options": [

        "Yes, because its frequency is 250 Hz",
        "No, because it's below 20 Hz",
        "Yes, because it's a sound wave"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "f = 1/T = 1/0.004 = 250 Hz. Since 20 Hz < 250 Hz < 20,000 Hz, it is audible."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Waves transfer energy through oscillations, but there is no net movement of matter (e.g., a floating object bobs in place)."

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "In longitudinal waves (e.g., sound), particles oscillate parallel to the direction of propagation. Transverse waves (e.g., light) oscillate perpendicularly."
