      "question": "A solution gives a blue precipitate with NaOH that turns black on heating. Which cation?",
      "options": ["Cu²⁺", "Fe²⁺", "Al³⁺", "Ca²⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Cu²⁺ gives blue Cu(OH)₂ with NaOH. On heating: Cu(OH)₂ → CuO (black) + H₂O"

      "question": "Which cation produces ammonia gas when warmed with NaOH solution?",
      "options": ["NH₄⁺", "Mg²⁺", "Zn²⁺", "Fe³⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "NH₄⁺ + OH⁻ → NH₃(g) + H₂O. The ammonia turns damp red litmus blue."

      "question": "A green solution gives a green precipitate with NaOH that turns brown on standing. Identify.",
      "options": ["Fe²⁺", "Fe³⁺", "Ni²⁺", "Cr³⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Fe²⁺ gives pale green solution and green Fe(OH)₂ precipitate. In air, it oxidizes to brown Fe(OH)₃."

      "question": "Which cation gives a white precipitate with NaOH that dissolves in excess NaOH?",
      "options": ["Zn²⁺", "Ca²⁺", "Mg²⁺", "Fe²⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Zn²⁺ gives white Zn(OH)₂ with NaOH, which dissolves in excess to form [Zn(OH)₄]²⁻."

    {
      "question": "A solution gives a red-brown precipitate with NaOH. With NH₃, it gives the same red-brown precipitate. Which cation?",
      "options": ["Fe³⁺", "Cu²⁺", "Al³⁺", "Zn²⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Fe³⁺ gives red-brown Fe(OH)₃ with both NaOH and NH₃. The precipitate is insoluble in excess."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cation gives a white precipitate with NaOH that is insoluble in excess NaOH but dissolves in acids?",
      "options": ["Ca²⁺", "Al³⁺", "Zn²⁺", "NH₄⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Ca²⁺ gives white Ca(OH)₂ with NaOH, insoluble in excess but soluble in acids: Ca(OH)₂ + 2H⁺ → Ca²⁺ + 2H₂O."

    {
      "question": "A cation gives white precipitate with NaOH soluble in excess. With NH₃, it gives white precipitate soluble in excess. Identify.",

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Zn²⁺ gives white Zn(OH)₂ soluble in both excess NaOH (forms [Zn(OH)₄]²⁻) and excess NH₃ (forms [Zn(NH₃)₄]²⁺)."

    {
      "question": "Which cation gives no precipitate with NH₃ solution but gives white precipitate with NaOH?",
      "options": ["Ca²⁺", "Zn²⁺", "Al³⁺", "Cu²⁺"],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Ca²⁺ gives white precipitate with NaOH but no precipitate with NH₃ because ammonia solution is weakly alkaline, insufficient to precipitate Ca(OH)₂."
