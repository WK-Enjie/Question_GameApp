        "The mass number has increased by 1.",
        "The number of protons has increased by 1.",
        "The atom has gained a proton.",
        "The atom has lost one electron."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The '+' indicates a positive charge, which results from the loss of one or more electrons. The number of protons remains unchanged."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Mass number = protons + neutrons = 35. Atomic number = protons = 17. The element with atomic number 17 is chlorine (Cl)."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number = 14 - 6 = 8."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Total subatomic particles = protons + neutrons + electrons. Protons = 9, Neutrons = 10 (19-9), Electrons = 9 (neutral atom). Total = 9 + 10 + 9 = 28."

      "explanation": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same proton number) that differ in their neutron number (and hence mass number)."
