      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Mass is a base quantity measured in kilograms (kg). Force, speed, and energy are derived quantities calculated from base quantities."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "The prefix 'milli' means one-thousandth (10⁻³ or 0.001). For example, 1 milligram = 0.001 grams and 1 millisecond = 0.001 seconds."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "1 kilometre = 1,000 metres. So 3.6 km = 3.6 × 1,000 = 3,600 m. The prefix 'kilo' means one thousand (10³)."

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "1 litre = 1,000 millilitres, so 750 mL = 750 ÷ 1,000 = 0.75 L. Moving from milli- to base unit divides by 1,000."

        "It changes during motion"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Speed is derived because it is calculated from base quantities: speed = distance (length) ÷ time. Both length and time are base quantities."
