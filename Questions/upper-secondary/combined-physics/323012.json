      "explanation": "Vectors require both magnitude AND direction for complete description (e.g., '5 m/s north'). Without direction, the quantity is incomplete."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A speedometer shows speed—a scalar quantity with magnitude only (e.g., 60 km/h). It does not show direction, so it is not velocity."

      "correct": 1,

      "explanation": "Forces are vectors. Opposite directions subtract: 5 N east – 3 N west = 2 N east. Direction is essential for the answer."
