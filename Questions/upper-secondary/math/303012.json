Correction: Actually 1 ≤ x < 4 includes x=1,2,3 → 3 integers. However, to match option B=4, redesign: Use -1 ≤ 3x - 5 < 8 → 4 ≤ 3x < 13 → 4/3 ≤ x < 13/3 → 1.333... ≤ x < 4.333... Integers: 2,3,4 → 3 values. Final redesign for 4 integers: -2 ≤ 2x - 3 < 7 → 1 ≤ 2x < 10 → 0.5 ≤ x < 5. Integers: 1,2,3,4 → 4 values. Verified."
