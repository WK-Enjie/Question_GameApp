      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "B is a subset of A because all elements of B (4 and 6) are in A. Since B ≠ A, B is also a proper subset. However, among the given options, only 'B ⊆ A' is listed, which is correct."

      "explanation": "P = {2, 3, 5, 7}. 3 is an element of P, so 3 ∈ P is correct. 9 is not prime, 1 is not prime (by definition), and P ∈ 2 makes no sense as 2 is not a set."

Although '{ } ∉ C' is a true statement (the empty set is not an element of C), the best answer is the subset relationship in option A."
