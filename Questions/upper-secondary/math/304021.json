    {
      "question": "A fair six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4?",
      "options": ["2/3", "1/6", "1/3", "1/2"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Numbers greater than 4: 5 and 6 (2 outcomes). Total outcomes: 6. Probability = 2/6 = 1/3."

      "question": "A box contains 8 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 7 green balls. If one ball is picked at random, what is the probability it is NOT blue?",

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Total balls = 20. Not blue = red + green = 8 + 7 = 15. Probability = 15/20 = 3/4."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A certain event has probability 1. An impossible event has probability 0."

      "question": "A spinner has 10 equal sections numbered 1 to 10. What is the probability of getting a number divisible by 3?",
      "options": ["1/5", "2/5", "3/10", "1/2"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Numbers divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9 (3 outcomes). Total outcomes: 10. Probability = 3/10."

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "For mutually exclusive events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.25 + 0.40 = 0.65."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Total letters in 'PROBABILITY' = 11. Letter 'B' appears 2 times. Probability = 2/11."

      "question": "Which of these events are mutually exclusive when rolling a fair die once?",
      "options": ["Getting a factor of 6 and getting an even number", "Getting an odd number and getting a prime number", "Getting a number less than 3 and getting a number greater than 4", "Getting a multiple of 2 and getting a multiple of 3"],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Less than 3: {1,2}. Greater than 4: {5,6}. No common outcomes → mutually exclusive."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "P(not snow) = 1 - P(snow) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8."

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "White or yellow = 4 + 5 = 9 marbles. Total = 15. Probability = 9/15 = 3/5."

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "P(A or B) = 0.3 + 0.45 = 0.75. P(neither) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25."

      "question": "In a survey, 40% of people like coffee, 30% like tea, and 10% like both. If a person is chosen at random, what is P(like coffee only)?",
      "options": ["0.40", "0.30", "0.10", "0.70"],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Coffee only = total coffee (40%) - both (10%) = 30%. So P(coffee only) = 0.30."
