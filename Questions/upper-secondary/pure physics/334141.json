    {
      "question": "A current of 2.5 A flows through a circuit for 4 minutes. Calculate the total charge that passes through the circuit.",
      "options": [
        "600 C",
        "150 C",
        "10 C",
        "1000 C"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Using Q = I × t. First convert time: 4 minutes = 4 × 60 = 240 seconds. Then Q = 2.5 A × 240 s = 600 C."
    },
    {
      "question": "If 3000 J of work is done to move 150 C of charge through a component, what is the potential difference across it?",
      "options": [
        "20 V",
        "45 V",
        "0.05 V",

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Using V = W/Q. V = 3000 J ÷ 150 C = 20 V. This means 20 joules of energy are transferred per coulomb of charge."
    },
    {
      "question": "A resistor has a potential difference of 12 V across it and carries a current of 0.4 A. What is its resistance?",
      "options": [
        "30 Ω",

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Using V = IR, so R = V/I. R = 12 V ÷ 0.4 A = 30 Ω. This follows Ohm's Law: current is directly proportional to voltage for an ohmic conductor."

    {
      "question": "Which factor does NOT affect the resistance of a wire?",
      "options": [

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Resistance of a wire is given by R = ρL/A, where ρ is resistivity (material), L is length, A is cross-sectional area. Voltage applied affects current but not the inherent resistance."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Resistance is directly proportional to length (R ∝ L). Doubling the length doubles the resistance because electrons have to travel twice as far through the material."
    },
    {
      "question": "A wire has resistance R. If its diameter is doubled (keeping same material and length), what is its new resistance?",
      "options": [

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Area is proportional to diameter². Doubling diameter increases area by 4× (A ∝ d²). Since R ∝ 1/A, resistance becomes R/4."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Glass is an insulator with very high resistivity (~10¹² Ωm). Conductors have low resistivity: silver (1.6×10⁻⁸), copper (1.7×10⁻⁸), aluminium (2.8×10⁻⁸) Ωm."

        "Ω/m²"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "From R = ρL/A, rearranging gives ρ = RA/L. Units: (Ω × m²)/m = Ω m. Resistivity is characteristic of a material at a specific temperature."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "For an ohmic conductor, V ∝ I (Ohm's Law). Graph of V against I is a straight line through the origin with constant gradient = resistance."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "For metals, resistance increases with temperature because atoms vibrate more, causing more collisions with electrons, impeding their flow."

      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "For identical resistors in parallel: R_total = R/n = 6 Ω ÷ 3 = 2 Ω. Parallel connection provides multiple paths, reducing total resistance."
