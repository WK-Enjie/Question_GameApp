    {
      "question": "Which apparatus would be most suitable for measuring exactly 25.0 cm³ of a solution?",
      "options": [
        "Burette",
        "Pipette",
        "Measuring cylinder",
        "Beaker"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A pipette is designed to deliver a fixed, precise volume of liquid, such as 25.0 cm³. Burettes measure variable volumes, while measuring cylinders and beakers are less precise."

    {
      "question": "Which method is most suitable for separating a mixture of ethanol and water?",
      "options": [
        "Filtration",
        "Fractional distillation",
        "Sublimation",
        "Using a separating funnel"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Ethanol and water are miscible liquids with different boiling points (ethanol 78°C, water 100°C). Fractional distillation separates them based on these boiling points."

    {
      "question": "Which drying agent is suitable for drying ammonia gas?",
      "options": [
        "Concentrated sulfuric acid",
        "Calcium oxide",
        "Fused calcium chloride",
        "Silica gel"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Ammonia is a basic gas. Concentrated sulfuric acid would react with it. Calcium oxide (a base) is suitable as it does not react with ammonia and absorbs water."

    {
      "question": "Which technique would you use to separate sand from a mixture of sand and salt?",
      "options": [
        "Distillation",
        "Filtration followed by evaporation",
        "Fractional distillation",
        "Paper chromatography"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "Add water to dissolve the salt. Filter to separate insoluble sand. Evaporate the filtrate to obtain solid salt."
    },
    {
      "question": "In paper chromatography, what does the Rf value represent?",
      "options": [
        "The ratio of distance travelled by solvent to distance travelled by solute",
        "The ratio of distance travelled by solute to distance travelled by solvent",
        "The time taken for the solute to travel",
        "The concentration of the solute in the mixture"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Rf = distance moved by solute spot ÷ distance moved by solvent front. It is characteristic for a substance under specific conditions."

    {
      "question": "What apparatus is best for measuring the volume of gas produced in a reaction over time?",
      "options": [
        "Burette",
        "Pipette",
        "Gas syringe",
        "Measuring cylinder"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A gas syringe allows accurate measurement of gas volume produced at regular time intervals, making it ideal for studying rates of reaction."

    {
      "question": "Which method separates immiscible liquids like oil and water?",
      "options": [
        "Fractional distillation",
        "Simple distillation",
        "Using a separating funnel",
        "Filtration"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Immiscible liquids form distinct layers. A separating funnel allows the denser liquid (water) to be drained off from the bottom."
    },
    {
      "question": "A substance changes directly from solid to gas upon heating. What purification method is this?",
      "options": [
        "Distillation",
        "Crystallisation",
        "Sublimation",
        "Evaporation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Sublimation is the process where a solid turns directly into a gas without passing through the liquid phase, used to purify substances like iodine or ammonium chloride."

    {
      "question": "Which piece of apparatus provides the most precise measurement of temperature during a reaction?",
      "options": [
        "Alcohol thermometer",
        "Mercury thermometer",
        "Digital thermometer with probe",
        "All are equally precise"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "A digital thermometer with a probe typically provides a faster response and more precise reading to the nearest 0.1°C compared to traditional liquid thermometers."

    {
      "question": "Two spots on a chromatogram have Rf values of 0.45 and 0.60. Which spot travelled further?",
      "options": [
        "The spot with Rf = 0.45",
        "The spot with Rf = 0.60",
        "They travelled the same distance",
        "Cannot be determined from Rf alone"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Rf is distance of spot ÷ distance of solvent. A higher Rf means the spot moved a greater proportion of the solvent's distance, so it travelled further up the paper."
