      "question": "In an experiment, 0.1 mol/dm³ HCl (strong acid) and 0.1 mol/dm³ CH₃COOH (weak acid) were compared. Which statement is true?",
      "options": [
        "Both have the same concentration of H⁺ ions",
        "HCl has a higher concentration of H⁺ ions",
        "CH₃COOH has a higher concentration of H⁺ ions",
        "Both have the same pH but different conductivities"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Strong acids like HCl dissociate completely, while weak acids like CH₃COOH dissociate partially. Therefore, at the same concentration, HCl produces more H⁺ ions and has a lower pH."

      "question": "25.0 cm³ of 0.100 mol/dm³ NaOH neutralises 20.0 cm³ of H₂SO₄. What is the concentration of the sulfuric acid? (H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O)",

      "explanation": "Moles of NaOH = 0.025 dm³ × 0.100 = 0.0025 mol. From equation, 2 mol NaOH : 1 mol H₂SO₄. Moles H₂SO₄ = 0.0025 / 2 = 0.00125 mol. Concentration = moles / volume = 0.00125 mol / 0.020 dm³ = 0.0625 mol/dm³."

      "question": "Which of the following would react the fastest with magnesium ribbon at the same concentration?",
      "options": [
        "Ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH)",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, fully dissociated, providing the highest concentration of H⁺ ions to react with magnesium. Weak acids like ethanoic and carbonic acid dissociate less, providing fewer H⁺ ions and reacting slower."

      "question": "A 0.01 mol/dm³ solution of a monoprotic acid HA has a pH of 3. What can be deduced about acid HA?",

      "points": 15,
      "explanation": "For a 0.01 M strong monoprotic acid: [H⁺] = 0.01 M = 10⁻² M, so pH = 2. Given pH = 3, [H⁺] = 10⁻³ M = 0.001 M, which is less than 0.01 M, so it's NOT fully dissociated. Therefore, it must be a weak acid."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Electrical conductivity depends on concentration of ions. HCl (strong acid) dissociates completely: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻. Ethanoic acid (weak acid) dissociates partially: CH₃COOH ⇌ H⁺ + CH₃COO⁻. Therefore, HCl provides more ions to carry current."

      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]. Weak acids have lower [H⁺] at the same concentration because they do not fully dissociate. This results in a higher (less acidic) pH value compared to strong acids."

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Neutralisation depends on moles of acid, not strength. Both are monoprotic acids, so 0.1 M solutions contain the same number of moles of acidic H⁺ per volume that can be neutralised. Their rates, conductivity, and pH (color) differ."
