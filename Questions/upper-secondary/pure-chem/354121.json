    {
      "question": "What does the term 'oxidation' mean in terms of electron transfer?",
      "options": [
        "Gain of electrons",
        "Loss of electrons",
        "Gain of protons",
        "Loss of protons"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Oxidation is the loss of electrons. A useful mnemonic is OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain."

    {
      "question": "In the reaction Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu, which substance is oxidised?",
      "options": [
        "Zinc",
        "Copper",
        "Sulfate ion",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Zinc atoms lose electrons to form Zn²⁺ ions: Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻. This is oxidation. Copper ions gain electrons: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu, which is reduction."

      "question": "What is the oxidation state of sulfur in H₂SO₄?",
      "options": [
        "+4",
        "+6",
        "-2",
        "+2"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "H is +1 (×2 = +2), O is -2 (×4 = -8). Let S = x. Sum = 0: +2 + x - 8 = 0 → x - 6 = 0 → x = +6."

      "question": "Which of the following is a reducing agent?",
      "options": [
        "A substance that gains electrons",
        "A substance that loses electrons",
        "A substance that is oxidised",
        "Both B and C"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "A reducing agent causes another substance to be reduced by losing electrons itself. Therefore, it is oxidised in the process."

      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Na is +1, O is -2. Let Cl = x. +1 + x - 2 = 0 → x - 1 = 0 → x = +1."

        "Magnesium oxide",
        "Both magnesium and oxygen"

      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Oxygen gains electrons (from O₂ to O²⁻ in MgO), so it is reduced. The substance that is reduced is the oxidising agent."

      "question": "Which of the following changes represents oxidation?",
      "options": [
        "Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺",

        "Cu → Cu²⁺",
        "MnO₄⁻ → Mn²⁺"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "Cu → Cu²⁺ involves loss of electrons (0 to +2), which is oxidation. The others involve gain of electrons (reduction)."

      "question": "What is the oxidation state of nitrogen in NO₂?",

        "+2",

      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "O is -2 (×2 = -4). Let N = x. x - 4 = 0 → x = +4."

      "question": "In a redox reaction, if iron changes from Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺, what has happened to iron?",
      "options": [
        "It has been oxidised",
        "It has been reduced",
        "It has been neutralised",
        "It has been displaced"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ involves loss of one electron (increase in oxidation state from +2 to +3), so it is oxidation."

    {
      "question": "Which substance is always the oxidising agent in a combustion reaction?",
      "options": [
        "Fuel",
        "Carbon dioxide",

        "Oxygen"

      "correct": 3,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "In combustion, oxygen (O₂) gains electrons to form oxides (e.g., O²⁻ in CO₂ or H₂O), so it is always reduced and thus the oxidising agent."
