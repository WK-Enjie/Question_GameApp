    {
      "question": "Disproportionation is a redox reaction in which the same element in a single reactant is simultaneously oxidised and reduced. Which of the following reactions is an example of disproportionation?",
      "options": [
        "Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu",
        "Cl₂ + H₂O → HCl + HClO",
        "2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O",
        "Fe + 2HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "In Cl₂ + H₂O → HCl + HClO, chlorine (oxidation state 0 in Cl₂) is simultaneously reduced to -1 in HCl and oxidised to +1 in HClO. This satisfies the definition of disproportionation. The other options involve different elements undergoing oxidation and reduction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Disproportionation occurs when atoms of the same element in identical initial oxidation states undergo both oxidation and reduction in the same reaction. In 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂, what happens to oxygen?",
      "options": [
        "All oxygen atoms are oxidised",
        "All oxygen atoms are reduced",
        "Some oxygen atoms are oxidised, others are reduced",
        "Oxygen atoms undergo no change in oxidation state"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "In H₂O₂, all oxygen atoms start with oxidation state -1. In the products, oxygen in H₂O has oxidation state -2 (reduction) while oxygen in O₂ has oxidation state 0 (oxidation). Since the same element undergoes both processes, this is disproportionation."

      "question": "Consider the reaction: 2KMnO₄ + 10KI + 8H₂SO₄ → 2MnSO₄ + 6K₂SO₄ + 5I₂ + 8H₂O. Which substance is the oxidising agent?",

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "KMnO₄ contains Mn in +7 state (MnO₄⁻). In products, Mn is +2 (MnSO₄), so Mn gains electrons (reduction). The substance that is reduced is the oxidising agent."

    {
      "question": "In the reaction 2KMnO₄ + 10KI + 8H₂SO₄ → 2MnSO₄ + 6K₂SO₄ + 5I₂ + 8H₂O, what is the change in oxidation state of iodine?",

      "points": 12,
      "explanation": "In KI, iodine is I⁻ with oxidation state -1. In I₂, iodine has oxidation state 0. Change: -1 → 0 (loss of electrons = oxidation)."

      "question": "Which statement correctly describes the roles in the reaction between acidified KMnO₄ and KI?",
      "options": [
        "KMnO₄ is oxidised; KI is reduced",
        "KMnO₄ is the reducing agent; KI is the oxidising agent",
        "KMnO₄ is reduced; KI is oxidised",
        "Both KMnO₄ and KI are oxidised"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "Mn in KMnO₄ changes from +7 to +2 (gains electrons → reduced). I in KI changes from -1 to 0 (loses electrons → oxidised). KMnO₄ is the oxidising agent; KI is the reducing agent."

        "+4 and +2"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "In KMnO₄: K = +1, O = -2 (×4 = -8). Let Mn = x: +1 + x - 8 = 0 → x = +7. In MnSO₄: SO₄²⁻ has -2 charge, so Mn = +2."

        "+1 in NaCl and -1 in NaClO"

      "correct": 2,
      "points": 14,
      "explanation": "Chlorine starts with oxidation state 0 in Cl₂. In NaCl, Cl = -1 (reduction). In NaClO: Na = +1, O = -2, so Cl = +1 (oxidation). The same element (chlorine) undergoes both processes → disproportionation."
